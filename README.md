# Food Truck Locator

This project is a Python script that fetches food truck locations from a mock API and sends an email notification with the locations.

Problems: 
- Instagram API has changed and is highly restrictive.
- Instaloader has limited access to Instagram anymore.
- Facebook/Instagram is requiring an App Review for the API access needed.
- May cost money to use the API.
